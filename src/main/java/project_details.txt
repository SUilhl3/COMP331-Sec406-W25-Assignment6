This code is used to add 3 integers together the user inputs.
Users must input the three integers in
this test example we will use 1, 2 and 3 (outdated)
this test will use 2,4, and 6 as test numbers
a = 2
b = 4
c = 6
the sum should add up to 12.

Results ended with a 2 code was fixed to add the proper units

This code should also give the sum of all three numbers multiplied together
a = 2
b = 4
c = 6
the total sum should be 48.

(debuging process #1)
 - sum outcomes are not correct.
 - changed the outcomes presented in the proper outcomes
 - Addition was not displaying proper variables
 - swapped the values of sum to their respected outcomes
